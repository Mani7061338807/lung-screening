    {
      "question": "Who needs lung cancer screening?",
      "answer": "There are several guidelines regarding who should receive lung cancer screening. One organization called the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for people aged 50-80, who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within 15 years. \"Pack-year\" depends on how many cigarettes you smoke in a day for how many years. Screening can reduce the chances of death due to lung cancer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What factors lead to an increased risk of lung cancer?",
      "answer": "Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer. About 80% of lung cancer deaths are due to smoking. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, radon gas, asbestos, air pollution, and a family history of lung cancer."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does lung cancer screening work and are there risks to imaging?",
      "answer": "Lung cancer screening is performed with a test called a low-dose CT scan. It takes images of your lungs in a few minutes and is painless. It can detect abnormalities early. Risks may include false positives and exposure to radiation, but the benefits outweigh the risks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it important to undergo lung cancer screening?",
      "answer": "Lung cancer is often found at an advanced stage. Screening helps detect cancer early, making it more treatable and improving survival rates."
